audio data layout:

8 tracks, sample-based audio

BlipKit library?

LSDJ/M8 Tracker model (song -> chain -> phrase -> instrument -> samples)

metadata = ??? bytes
song = 256 bytes * 8 tracks
chain = 16 * 2 bytes * 255 chains
phrase = 16 * 12 bytes * 255 chains
inst = ??? bytes * 255 instruments
samples = ??? bytes * 128(?) samples
total = 0xE720 bytes + instr bytes + sample bytes

instrument:
sample index: 1 byte
asdr env: 4 bytes
